    "This dataset is collected using object detection and CCTV footage that identifies and counts the heads of individuals in motion. Algorithms compute the bearing of each detected head object, categorizing its movement into one of sixteen possible directional vectors derived from the eight cardinal and intercardinal directions (for example, from Northeast to Southwest or East to West). The data has been collected intermittently a period of roughly 3 years. The intermittency is unique to each sensor. To see a detailed overview of the data used in the EDA skip to {ref} `section 2.2<2.2.1.3>`."
